Project Description: Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a Java-based application that utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and MySQL to create a comprehensive solution for managing employee records within an organization. The system consists of three main modules: Admin, Employee, and New Employee. Each module serves a specific purpose in maintaining and updating employee information securely.

The Admin module acts as the central control hub, providing administrative privileges to authorized users. It allows administrators to manage user accounts, granting or revoking access to the system. Additionally, the Admin module enables administrators to view, edit, and delete employee records stored in the database.

The Employee module is designed for regular employees within the organization. Employees can access their own information, such as personal details, contact information, and employment history, by logging in with their unique user ID and password. They have the ability to update their own records, ensuring that the data remains accurate and up-to-date.

The New Employee module facilitates the addition of new employees to the system. It prompts users to enter relevant details about the new employee, such as name, address, contact information, position, and department. Before the new employee's information is stored in the database, the module validates the user ID and password provided, ensuring that only authorized personnel can create new employee records.

Key Features of the Employee Management System:

User Authentication: The system ensures secure access to the modules by validating user IDs and passwords.
CRUD Operations: The system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing employee records.
Database Connectivity: JDBC is utilized to establish a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database.
Admin Privileges: The Admin module grants administrators the authority to manage user accounts and employee records.
Employee Self-Service: Employees can update their personal information and keep their records accurate.
New Employee Registration: The system allows authorized users to add new employees by entering relevant details.
Data Validation: The system validates user inputs to maintain data integrity and prevent errors.
Overall, the Employee Management System provides a user-friendly interface for efficient management of employee records. It enhances data accuracy, security, and accessibility, simplifying the process of maintaining an up-to-date employee database within the organization.
